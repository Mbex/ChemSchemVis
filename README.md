# ChemSchemVis

Describes a chemical mechanism based on node (chemical species) and link (reactions) data. Currently this is set to read a static json file containing nodes and links, however in the future I aim to have an interactive feature where the user provides nodes and links.

The current version uses focuses on the atmospheric oxidation of benzene and borrows heavily from the [MCM](http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/) but includes some auto oxidation steps.
